    "description": "Li Jin is a co-founder and general partner at Variant, a crypto fund investing in Web3 and what Li calls the Ownership Economy. Li is full of massive ideas about the past, present, and future of digital economies. \n\nThe core thesis? Next-generation networks grow faster and bigger. The phase we're seeing emerge now with Web3 and crypto is deeply fascinating, with potential to shift power and ownership into the hands of users and creators.\n\nIn this new paradigm, everyone is a creator, and everyone is an owner. In addition to her work at Variant, Li is also a painter and an accomplished writer on Substack. After her appearance on the Creator Economy Panel, we knew she had to come back on Bankless to dive deep‚Äîthis time, into the Ownership Economy.\n\n------\n‚ú® DEBRIEF ‚ú® | Ryan & David's Unfiltered Thoughts on the Episode\nhttps://shows.banklesshq.com/p/debrief-the-ownership-economy-li\n\n------\nüì£ ALTO IRA | THE CRYPTO RETIREMENT ACCOUNT\nhttps://bankless.cc/AltoIRA\n\n------\nüöÄ SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER:          https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\nüéôÔ∏è SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST:                 http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\n\n------\nBANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS: \n\nüëÄ POLYGON | LAYER 2 DEFI\nhttps://bankless.cc/Polygon\n\n‚ùé ACROSS | BRIDGE TO LAYER 2\nhttps://bankless.cc/Across\n\nü¶ä METAMASK | THE CRYPTO WALLET\nhttps://bankless.cc/metamask\n\nüí≥ LEDGER | THE CRYPTO LIFE CARD\nhttps://bankless.cc/Ledger\n\nüßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è ALCHEMIX | SELF REPAYING LOANS\nhttps://bankless.cc/Alchemix\n\nü¶Ñ UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING\nhttps://bankless.cc/UniGrants\n\n------\nTopics Covered:\n\n0:00 Intro\n6:30 Creator vs Ownership Economy\n12:58 Phases of Economies\n17:34 The Web3 Renaissance\n21:53 Issues with the Early Internet\n27:11 Original Sin\n35:11 From Attention to Ownership\n38:48 Digital Scarcity\n47:41 Patronage Plus vs Regulation\n52:59 100 True Fans\n1:01:17 Programmable Business Models\n1:09:17 DAOs & Community Ownership\n1:14:48 Comparing Renaissances\n1:21:36 Wealth Inequality\n1:29:58 What YOU Can Do\n1:35:23 What ELSE You Can Do\n1:38:54 2022 Predictions\n1:42:35 Closing & Disclaimers\n\n------\nResources:\n\nLi on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/ljin18?s=20\n\nLi's Newsletter:\nhttps://li.substack.com/\n\nThe Web3 Renaissance:\nhttps://li.substack.com/p/the-web3-renaissance-a-golden-age\n\n100 True Fans:\nhttps://li-jin.co/2020/02/19/100-true-fans/\n\nThe Creator Economy:\nhttps://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-panel-the-creator-economy-jesse\n\nTweets Mentioned:\nhttps://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1434964132042846208\nhttps://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1422928459425271811\nhttps://twitter.com/ljin18/status/1404650885788098562\n\n-----\nNot financial or tax advice.
