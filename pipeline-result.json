I don't need to judge myself for that or take in other people's judgment on how much I should \"do\" like this is my life and this is what I like doing. [Music]\n\nI never heard of Gym Launch before, but all of a sudden, they were everywhere on my YouTube. And then when B he started saying that this gym was really a course, I was intrigued. He explained that originally, the big decision was whether to go the franchise route because he had six working locations and 26 years old at the time. But a mentor suggested licensing the model out instead, so he did. And it turns out, he says, franchising would have been harder anyway because with licensing he controls fulfillment- something that became an issue when they tried franchising (more on that later). \n\nAnyways, they started launching gyms and things seemed to be going well at first. They were making lots of money- around $100 000 per month per gymLaunch location.However, there was a flaw in the business model: they didn't control fulfillment. This meant that once they sold a program to someone, it was up to the facility (that may or may not have been struggling) to actually deliver on what was promised. And unfortunately, many times these customers would get disappointed with the product and ask for refunds-- costing Gym Launch thousands of dollars each time"

        "output": "\nAlex had been running gyms for a few years and was doing well, but he felt like something was missing. He wasn't quite sure what it was, but he knew he needed to learn more about marketing. So, he decided to go to Traffic and Conversion Summit. There, he met Russell Brunson and was immediately impressed. After the summit, Alex Googled Russell's name and found out about his mastermind program. Even though it was way outside of his budget, Alex applied and got in. \n\nAt the mastermind, everyone was presenting their business funnels and Alex realized that he could be teaching other gym owners how to do what he does instead of just running gyms himself. Brunson told him that he had the skill set of a level 10 opportunity but was only in a level 2 opportunity. \n\nThis realization hit Alex like a ton of bricks and completely changed his perspective. He realized that he could make way more money by helping others than by just running gyms himself. From there,Alex went on to create United Fitness- an organization dedicated to helping other gym owners succeed through providing resources, education, and support"

He started a software company that would help people do just that. His company quickly grew, and within two years, they were making $27 million in revenue with $17 million in EBITDA. A big part of their success was due to their offer - they would give new customers a discount if they signed up for a year-long contract, and then spread the payments out over that year. This made it much easier for people to say yes, and as a result, they closed a lot of deals."

By year three, Gym Launch was doing 37 million in top line sales with 13.4 million in EBITDA."

        "output": "\nIn December of 2018, Alex started a supplement company that used a drop shipping model. This meant that clients would never purchase directly from the company, but instead would receive retail kits with 130 bottles on them. The kits cost 100 dollars and allowed the client to stock their whole wall with samples of all the products. The company also sent out kiosks with an Amazon fire pre-loaded with their affiliate link. When someone made a purchase, it would automatically ship straight to their doorstep.\n\nThe first month the company launched, they did 1.7 million in sales. Alex attributes this success to two things: paying affiliates 40% commissions (to incentivize them to promote the product) and beta launching in December (to get a head start on competition).\n\nEventually, the business reached 37 million in annual revenue; however, due to some oversights on Alex's part, part of this revenue was lost when he lowered the price of his product from 800 dollars per week to 600 dollars per week (without seeing any increase in sales or decrease in churn)."

This man said that he and his wife had started a photography business that specialized in taking pictures of children and turning them into fairytale heroines. They did this to help their own daughter who had stopped speaking for nine months after being told she was stupid at school. Now, the couple wanted to expand their business model and teach others their methods so that they could continue helping children all over the world.\n\nAlex liked the idea of this mission-driven company and agreed to help them grow it by taking a minority interest in the business. He helped them secure funding and scale their operations so that they could open more locations and reach more people. The company flourished under his guidance and is now worth more than all of the businesses he previously owned combined."

He was curious about the numbers and how much it would cost to open a photographer studio. After some research, he found out that it would be less than what the panda express guy was making. Sean, Alex's friend, had recently called Grant Cardone and asked him questions about growing his business. On the call, Grant was very transparent about his net worth and how much money he had in the bank. This inspired Alex to be more open about his own finances.\n\nAlex is a big believer in sharing information and being transparent because he feels that it can help quell some of the insecurity that comes with entrepreneurship. He also believes that by providing value through free content, he is creating his own deal flow and opportunities for acquisitions. His mission is to document and share best practices for building wonderful businesses."

They mention that their partner does most of the work, while they occasionally come up with good ideas. Alex then begins to speak about their own drive and motivation. They say that originally, it came from insecurity and a need for approval, but now it is more compulsive or obsessive. Last year, they took some time off from work and traveled around, but found that there was not much to do. This year, they are back to working full-time because they enjoy it and feel empty without it."

I decided to look into what he did and found out that he lifted six times a day for just 10 minutes each time, coupled with a pure carbohydrate diet with no fat. The efficiency of storing carbs as fat is lower than storing fats as fat, so this would minimize the amount of surplus that gets stored as fat. I tried it myself and found that it worked wonders! Not only did I put on a ton of weight and strength, but my productivity increased tremendously because I had this nice cadence every 45 minutes that woke me back up."

He said that the biggest predictor of good sales is conviction, and that trust is what transfers conviction from one person to another. He explained that people are often afraid of confrontation in sales, but that you can sell without confrontation by using childlike curiosity. He ended by saying that when you're reading a really good book, it's almost like every sentence is packed with a fact and it's exhausting."

One thing that he mentioned that resonated with me was when he talked about how some people will get envious when they see other people's success. He said that it is important to study your reactions and figure out why you are feeling that way. If you are sharing information, make sure to speak to those who are going to take the positive from it instead of getting caught up in all of the negativity. I thought this was great advice for anyone who is trying to be successful in business."
