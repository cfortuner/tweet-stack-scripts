twitter thread about the following transcript:\n  Transcript:  i have come to accept that i love working and i don't need to judge myself for that or or take in other people's judgment on how much i should quote do like this is my life and this is what i like doing [Music] because i never heard of you before and i was like hey this guy is popping up all over my youtube all of a sudden what the hell is going on and b he's saying that this gym i don't know i call that a course which actually is incorrect if there's like one thing that i could make just for the almost for the audience's sake because like we were we were much closer to what a franchise would be um and overall in the very beginning that was what the big decision was like am i going to go the franchise route because i had six working locations i was 26 years old and they you know they worked and that's when a mentor was like you should stop owning all these gyms you need to license the model out and so that was when i kind of transitioned from b to c to b to b um what you might not know is that for two years i actually because i wasn't confident i was like i know it works in my six markets i was like but does it work in all of these markets so my wife and i actually did 32 gym turnarounds in the next two years so we'd fly out in person fix their pricing change how they did their layout change their sales just like a consultant like like a management consultant for a job it's exactly that and then um from there we you know we figured out we cleaned it up to just like completely dial it in um and then it i would love to say with some stroke of brilliance of like and then in my master plan i decided to start licensing um that was not what happened uh we ended up doing these launches and the flaw of the business model was that i didn't control the fulfillment so we would go in we would charge nothing it was pure performance we'd fly in and i would charge 100 of the upfront cash collected uh that we would do while we were there so we averaged about 100 000 in cash collected in 21 days and that's what we would average per gym that would come into so that means each gym is making an incremental 100 grand a month from your so if i were launching eight gyms in one month we would make eight hundred thousand dollars got it right oh that and this was when the model before you were like exactly doing gym live and so what ended up happening though was like and it started scaling really quick i was like [ __ ] this is this is the game like this is what i need to be doing this is awesome and they didn't have to spend money on ads they like they did literally nothing they gave me a place to go market and sell is basically what happened and so what happens we would dip out and then all these customers that we sold would then be fulfilled by a facility that was struggling because that's why they called us so they typically had pretty poor product and i didn't have the bandwidth to stay there for six weeks on top of that and retrain trainers and show them how to set up like i didn't have the time to do because we were marketing some of those times were there and so anyways we would fly out and then what happened in an unfortunate percentage they basically were like hey you signed up and paid this guy 500 i would give you the same thing for 200 refund with him and just sign up and i'll do everything through me and so within a matter of months i had uh like 150 000 in refunds between like three facilities because they talked to each other and then i was like [ __ ] yeah and i already incurred the cost of the marketing the flight the sales guy the hotel rental car everything what was the name of this gym franchise this this gym okay but i'll tell you this the original concept was gym rescue um it's like bar rescue that was kind of the idea um but you said jim motors didn't want to be rescued bingo so who doesn't want to get launched though right so it's gym launch even though you're already open um it's a nice branding switch uh and so anyways we were like okay this is not the model something's wrong here so i had to you basically keep selling more every month to cover the refunds from the month before it was horrible very stressful um and so my wife had a little side training business that she had kept she was doing like three or four thousand dollars a month um and i was like you know what screw the gym thing we know how to sell weight loss uh you know direct consumer that's what we're good at i was like why don't you become the face i'll go in the back and i'll just run the you know i'll run the acquisition side and it will sell like 16 week transformations just over the phone and so we started doing that that's it that that doesn't seem like a good idea does it right i mean it it started working 14 days we're doing a thousand bucks a day uh switching it and um well i just thought it was so crowded we're yeah i mean we're good like we're good at that you know like we that space we understand very well um and so we were able to do that and i was like all right the eight sales guys can come in we could do 8 000 a day selling these like the the the transformation programs great and so i had eight gyms i was supposed to launch the next month um and so i called him up and i was like hey we're not doing the thing we were doing before you know you didn't pay anything so best of luck you know i mean basically it was kind of what it is and then um the first guy was like dude i just refinanced my house i just maxed out my credit cards like i need this my buddy like filled his gym up with you like i know your thing works like i just need i please like help me and so um we heat and hog and finally i was like all right man listen i'll show you what to do i was like but i'm not flying out there to save your ass if you can't close and he was like no no that's fine that's fine and he was like well how much and this that was like the magic moment where i was like uh and so just to show you where i was at the time i picked the highest number i could think of with the intention of getting him to say no because i didn't want to do it and so i said six thousand dollars and he was like done and i was like i just remember looking at the phone and be like holy [ __ ] six thousand dog and so i hung up the phone and then i called the next guy who i was supposed to cancel on same spiel he was like how much i was like eight thousand dollars and he was like what are you giving these guys so that you're giving them a playbook to sell in their market which included what what did they do but you probably actually didn't even know what you were going to give them well so we had already had the entire the entire front end process was super super uh lubricated so like these are the ads these are the pages here's how you place them here's the targeting once they come in these are the five texts that you send here's how the reminder sequence works once they walk in the door here's how you set up your lobby here's where you need to sit this is that's the stuff that a gym owner would send to a client who wants to get trained so it's not a course it's also not like eos it's not like a back-end operations thing it's it's like a marketing machine you would you'd basically like i licensed the acquisition so we were the ads so it was ads that i was in because i was like these ones work so i would run these ads that i had written to pages that i had built and i would and so what i was doing but on on their url you basically were you were a services business 100 were a services business and the training component was like okay well how do you sell so instead of getting one on one i was like one and so what i did was i actually gave them my internal sales training so it was this thing that i put my guys through and like a lot it's kind of interesting because i fell into this where i think a lot of the the e-learning space try and create stuff to have stuff rather than creating uh as as short of a time commitment to get someone from point a to point b which is i needed to get a guy in who used to be selling shape mix from mlm and get him to close 500 deals day one with two hours of training and so that training is what i gave to them so i already had everything i just didn't have the marketing part so all i did was i built the marketing part over the weekend because i already had the ads i didn't make a training for it but the training for like how do you weigh them in how do you do the food stuff how do like all that stuff already made because i had to do that during the gym rescue side so i literally just added in how to run the ads and then the whole product was there and um we helped them implement it implement the acquisition system within the business and the average gym collected thirty thousand dollars in additional cash in the first 30 days so we would do a hundred but them not being as good as us still did thirty thousand dollars additional cash in the first 30 days and so the price point for the for the system was was 16 grand so they were stoked and then at that point we signed three-year licensing agreements for 42 000 a year um so they were like what else do you have and what would happen and what didn't bring their gym because all of a sudden they go from 100 members to 250 in two months and be like how do i hire trainers how do i scale a sales team how do i it'll be like and then all of the other problems emerged and we already had done this because i had six gyms so i was like here's my ads for trainers here's how i train them here's how we set up the classes to maximize square footage here's how we do the ascensions into semi-privates here's and so we just we just did the whole thing what could i google to see one of these gyms i i want to see like like did you do that i know you use click funnels i think i could tell by the favicon because i like click funnels too but you what like can i google something to see one of your uh clients one of your students i don't know what you call them yeah one of their channels look different because they're all they don't they don't take my brand so franchise is system fee name right so we were just system and fit otherwise i'd be operating as an illegal franchise and so let's zoom out for a second so you basically go from"
